<!--TITLE:[Supported Applications List]-->

<h1>Supported Applications List</h1>

<p>This is a working version of the application lists which we hope to support 'officially'
for Wine 0.9. Do not worry too much about formatting. It is not very good, and will
most likely change before it goes to WineHQ. Please send comments, and suggestions,
about the list to <a href="mailto:clozano@andago.com">Carlos Lozano</a>;
direct formatting related flames to <a href="mailto:dpaun@rogers.com">Dimitrie O. Paun</a>.</p>

<h2>The Gold List</h2>

   out-of-the-box Wine installation make it to the Gold list: <br>
