<h1>About Wine</h1>

<p>Wine is a translation layer (a program loader) capable of running
Windows applications on Linux and other POSIX compatible operating
systems.  Windows programs running in Wine act as native programs would,
running without the performance or memory usage penalties of an emulator,
with a similar look and feel to other applications on your desktop.</p>

<p>The Wine project started in 1993 as a way to support running 
Windows 3.1 programs on Linux. Bob Amstadt was the original 
coordinator, but turned it over fairly early on to Alexandre 
Julliard, who has run it ever since. Over the years, ports 
for other Unixes have been added, along with support for Win32
as Win32 applications became popular.</p>

<p>Wine is still under development, and it is not yet suitable for 
general use. Nevertheless, many people find it useful in running
a growing number of Windows programs. Please see the
<a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/">Application Database</a>
for success and failure reports for hundreds of Windows 
programs, as well as the <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/">Bug
Tracking Database</a> for a list of known issues, and the
<a href="{$root}/site/status">Status</a> page for a global view on Wine's 
implementation progress.</p>
