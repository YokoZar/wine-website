Wine for Debian based distributions</h1>

<p>Debian and Debian based distributions, such as Ubuntu, utilize a special tool
for managing packages known as APT.  APT is able to automagically install all of
the needed dependencies for a software package, as well as keep the package 
up to date, by scanning what are known as APT repositories.  Debian based 
distributions have their own repositories of software, many of which include
Wine, however we keep the latest available packages here for download.</p>

<p>Packages here are designed to function on Debian unstable, and are meant to 
replace the older Debian-provided ones.  Like most packages for Debian unstable, 
these packages also work in Ubuntu Linux, where they are tested regularly. </p>

<h2>Installing from the WineHQ APT Repository with Synaptic:</h2>

<p>To install Wine from the WineHQ APT repository, you need to configure APT to
look in the right place for the Wine packages.  On Ubuntu systems, and those 
using the Synaptic Package Manager, this can be done easily by opening up 
Synaptic and selecting Settings->Repositories.  Then click add, select custom, 
and enter the following:</p>

<i><p>deb http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/ binary/</p></i>

<p>Then, simply click reload and search for the package 'wine' for installation. 
If you already have a 'wine' package installed, selecting mark all upgrades and
opting for the "smart upgrade" option should update Wine to the newest version.
</p>

<p>Currently, we only have i386 binary packages available. If you do not use an 
i386 architecture, or wish to compile the package in an optimized way, you can 
build the wine package using the source repository instead. To do this, add a 
source repository with the the following:</p>

<i><p>deb-src http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/ source/</p></i>

<p>Then, see the instructions below for building the package in the console.</p>

<h2>Installing from the WineHQ APT Repository with the console:</h2>

<p>If your system doesn't use a graphical package manager like Synaptic, you 
will need to edit APT's configuration file by hand. You will need root access to
do this and run the commands below. Switch to root by typing '<b>su</b>'. If you 
are an Ubuntu user, you can instead precede each command with '<b>sudo</b>'. Now, 
use your favorite text editor to open the file /etc/apt/sources.list or use the 
console editor by typing '<b>nano /etc/apt/sources.list</b>' and then add the 
following lines to the end:</p>

<i><p>deb http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/ binary/<br>
deb-src http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/ source/</p></i>

<p>Then, you can run '<b>apt-get update</b>' to update APT's package information. 
Finally, to install Wine, do '<b>apt-get install wine</b>'.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure that apt-get will install the WineHQ wine package
instead of the Debian wine package (which usually has the same version),
then add something like the following entry to /etc/apt/preferences:</p>

<i><p>Package: wine<br>
Pin: release l=WineHQ APT Repository<br>
Pin-Priority: 1000</p></i>

<p>Or alternatively use a modified rule to adjust the installation relationship
between WineHQ and Debian packages in a different way.</p>

<h2>Building the Wine Package from Source using APT:</h2>

<p>APT also allows easy compilation from source of a package.  This is useful if
there is no binary package available for your architecture, or if you wish to 
create a fresh .deb file from scratch.  To do this, first follow the 
instructions for installing from the console above, except instead of running
apt-get install wine run '<b>apt-get build-dep wine</b>'.  This will download the 
needed development packages for your system to make the wine package.  Then, 
run '<b>apt-get --build source wine</b>', have a snack, and wait for the 
compiling to finish.</p>

<p>To install your newly created package (which should be in whatever directory
you were in when you ran apt-get --build source), run '<b>dpkg -i wine*.deb</b>' 
as root.</p>
