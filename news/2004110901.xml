  <title>AppDB and Developer Docs Update</title>
  <body>
    Two WineHQ additions appeared this week.  If you've aspired to become a 
    Wine hacker, you will appreciate a 
    <a href="/site/developer-cheatsheet">quick introduction</a> written by 
    Mike Hearn.  It's not a replacement for the 
    <a href="/site/docs/wine-devel/index">Wine Developer Guide</a>, but it
    does serve as a good starting point.  Also this week, Chris Morgan 
    and Tony Lambregts modified the 
    <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org">AppDB</a> to allow folks to
    take over an application and become a maintainer.  Then you can
    edit comments, change app descriptions, and all kinds of other good stuff.
    If there's an app you regularly use under Wine, please consider 
    maintaining an AppDB page and help track regressions.  Have any ideas for 
    improving the interface?  <a href="mailto:wine-devel_at_winehq.org">Let
    us know!</a>
