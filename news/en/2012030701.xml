<title>Wine 1.4 Released</title>
<body>
<p> The Wine team is proud to announce that the stable release Wine 1.4 is now available.</p>
<p> This release represents 20 months of development effort and over 16,000 individual changes. The main highlights are the new DIB graphics engine, a redesigned audio stack, and full support for bidirectional text and character shaping.</p>
<p> It also contains a lot of improvements across the board, as well as support for many new applications, notably Microsoft Office 2010. See the <a href="{$root}/announce/1.4">release notes</a> below for a summary of the major changes.</p>
<p> This release is dedicated to the memory of G&#233; (Greg) van Geldorp, who passed away in May 2011. Greg single-handedly designed, built, and maintained the Wine Testbot, which has become a cornerstone of our development process. The high quality of this release owes a lot to his work. He is greatly missed by us all.</p>
